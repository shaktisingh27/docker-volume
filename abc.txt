we use named volumes for storage and if docker is remoced or shut down then data still persist 

we us named volume as such 

in docker run command we add flaf for it
 -v <name of folder that we want in our systmem>:<relative path n docker file for that >

 eg docker run -d -p 3000:80 --rm --name feedback-app -v feedback:/app/feedback feedback-node:volumes

 docker volume ls to list all volumes
 docker volume rn <volume name> to remove volumes
 docker volume prune to remove all volumes that are not being used by containers
