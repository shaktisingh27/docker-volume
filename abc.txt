we use named volumes for storage and if docker is remoced or shut down then data still persist 

we us named volume as such 

in docker run command we add flaf for it
 -v <name of folder that we want in our systmem>:<relative path n docker file for that >

 eg docker run -d -p 3000:80 --rm --name feedback-app -v feedback:/app/feedback feedback-node:volumes

 docker volume ls to list all volumes
 docker volume rn <volume name> to remove volumes
 docker volume prune to remove all volumes that are not being used by containers

 Docker bind mount is same as named volume type but here we specify local project folder and folder in docker app

 -v $(pwd):/app
  then use use anonymous volume through terminal or through docker file to save nodemodules to be over rien by binding process as local 
  files over rides the docker container file so causes error for node modules 

  either
  VOLUMES["/app/node_modules"] image need to be created again orr -v /app/node_modules anonmous volume if not want to create image again
